In healthy adults, there are two normal heart sounds, often described as a lub and a dub (or dup), that occur in sequence with each heartbeat. These are the first heart sound (S1) and second heart sound (S2), produced by the closing of the atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves, respectively.\n","\n","#### Problem \n","An estimated 17.1 million people died from CVDs in 2004, representing 29% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.2 million were due to coronary heart disease. Any method which can help to detect signs of heart disease c\n"," \n","The problem is of particular interest to machine learning researchers as it involves classification of audio sample data, where distinguishing between classes of interest is non-trivial. Data is gathered in real-world situations and frequently contains background noise of every conceivable type. The differences between heart sounds corresponding to different heart symptoms can also be extremely subtle and challenging to separate. Success in classifying this form of data requires extremely robust classifiers. Despite its medical significance, to date this is a relatively unexplored application for machine learning.

The difference between the cepstrum and the mel-frequency cepstrum is that in the MFC, the frequency bands are equally spaced on the mel scale, which approximates the human auditory system's response more closely than the linearly-spaced frequency bands used in the normal cepstrum. This frequency warping can allow for better representation of sound, for example, in audio compression.\n","\n","MFCCs are commonly derived as follows:\n","-Take the Fourier transform of (a windowed excerpt of) a signal.\n","-Map the powers of the spectrum obtained above onto the mel scale, using triangular overlapping windows.\n","-Take the logs of the powers at each of the mel frequencies.\n","-Take the discrete cosine transform of the list of mel log powers, as if it were a signal.\n","The MFCCs are the amplitudes of the resulting spectrum.\n","\n","In general, a 39-dimensional feature vector is used which is composed of first 13 MFCCs and their corresponding 13 delta and 13 delta-delta."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"2102938e8fce643909e6a7930476456fc740175f","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Here's a sample generate mfccs from a wave file\n","normal_file=INPUT_DIR+\"/set_a/normal__201106111136.wav\"\n","#y, sr = librosa.load(sample_file, offset=7, duration=7)\n","y, sr = librosa.load(normal_file)\n","mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr)\n","print (mfccs)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"a8b3d78ea6c1dc6fe5da4a9baf0ed3ebd69045b4","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Use a pre-computed log-power Mel spectrogram\n","S = librosa.feature.melspectrogram(y=y, sr=sr, n_mels=128,fmax=8000)\n","log_S=librosa.feature.mfcc(S=librosa.power_to_db(S))\n","print (log_S)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"3ebbb83887aa6c761a47494c963898fb6d5e724a","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Get more components\n","mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=40)\n","#print (mfccs)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"b950bd3ebc822bac34a9f9ee48112d2f40107795","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Visualize the MFCC series\n","# Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)\n","plt.figure(figsize=(12, 3))\n","librosa.display.specshow(mfccs, x_axis='time')\n","plt.colorbar()\n","plt.title('Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)')\n","plt.tight_layout()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"974b6202aa14d6fbea5ff41ce07f64170a79fa7b","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Compare different DCT bases\n","m_slaney = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, dct_type=2)\n","\n","#m_dct1 = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, dct_type=1)\n","plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n","#plt.subplot(3, 1, 1)\n","#librosa.display.specshow(m_dct1, x_axis='time')\n","#plt.title('Discrete cosine transform (dct_type=1)')\n","#plt.colorbar()\n","m_htk = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, dct_type=3)\n","plt.subplot(3, 1, 2)\n","librosa.display.specshow(m_slaney, x_axis='time')\n","plt.title('RASTAMAT / Auditory toolbox (dct_type=2)')\n","plt.colorbar()\n","plt.subplot(3, 1, 3)\n","librosa.display.specshow(m_htk, x_axis='time')\n","plt.title('HTK-style (dct_type=3)')\n","plt.colorbar()\n","plt.tight_layout()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"292db70358addcba58cbfc8412966a46dfb46165"},"source":["### Sound Feature: Onset "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"834d1e52d4b61537b6962c0a550b46b15233ca1b"},"source":["#### onset detector\n","\n","Basic onset detector.
